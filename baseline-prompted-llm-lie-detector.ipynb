Athenian hegemony began with the defeat of its rival city-states in the Persian Wars, which took place in the early 5th century BCE. The victory made Athens the most powerful city-state in Greece and it quickly expanded its power and influence by forming the Delian League to ensure its control of the Aegean Sea. This angered Sparta, which saw Athensâ€™ growing influence as a threat to its own power. Sparta organized an alliance of powerful Greek city-states called the Peloponnesian League to counter the growing power of Athens. This alliance relied on Spartaâ€™s powerful land army to maintain its grip on the surrounding regions. The alliance lasted for 28 years, until Athens and its allies in the Delian League suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sparta and its allies in the Peloponnesian League in 404 BCE.
