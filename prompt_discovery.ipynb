    "# Prompt Discovery for Weak Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a comprehensive system to discover effective lying prompts for weak language models. Instead of lowering thresholds, we systematically test different prompt formulations to find ones that actually elicit strong lying and double-down behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct API Testing**: Bypasses caching issues by testing prompts directly\n",
    "2. **Systematic Categories**: Tests multiple categories of prompts designed for weak models\n",
    "3. **Dual Metrics**: Measures both lying effectiveness AND double-down persistence\n",
    "4. **Integration Ready**: Outputs can be directly used in the main lie detection pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find prompts with ‚â•0.8 double-down rate and ‚â•0.5 lying rate\n",
    "- Enable weak-to-strong lie detection experiments\n",
    "- Understand which prompt categories work best for different models"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive system for discovering effective lying prompts for weak models. The key outcomes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Systematic Testing**: We test many different prompt formulations across multiple categories\n",
    "2. **Direct Validation**: Each prompt is tested directly via API calls to ensure accuracy\n",
    "3. **Dual Metrics**: We measure both lying effectiveness and double-down persistence\n",
    "4. **Cross-Model Analysis**: We identify prompts that work across multiple weak models\n",
    "5. **Integration Ready**: Results can be directly imported into the main tutorial pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The discovered prompts can now be used in weak-to-strong lie detection experiments while maintaining the original high threshold standards (‚â•0.8 double-down rate)."
